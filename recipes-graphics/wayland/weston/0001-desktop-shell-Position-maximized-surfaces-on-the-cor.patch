Subject: [PATCH] desktop-shell: Position maximized surfaces on the correct
 output.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

During a maximize event, a surface was previously always put back to
the primary output after one frame on the correct output, while keeping
its size.  This was caused by the shell surfaceâ€™s last_{width,height}
not being reset when it was either fullscreen or maximized, leading to
the unmaximize/maximize dance being done at each commit.

This was introduced in 8f9d90a84bb2888b074fea93c4a28778bc6439c6.

Changes since v1:
- Fix the actual issue instead of a symptom.
